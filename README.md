# 42Projects

Welcome to **42Projects**! This repository contains all the projects I will be completing as part of the **42 Common Core Curriculum**. The projects span a wide range of computer science topics, fostering collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving.

## About 42 Abu Dhabi
[42 Abu Dhabi](https://www.42abudhabi.ae) is an innovative coding school based on peer-to-peer learning. Its project-based approach encourages students to explore and grow as developers through hands-on experience.

The Common Core Curriculum is designed to provide a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development while emphasizing teamwork and self-learning.

## Repository Structure
Each project will be contained in its own directory with:
- Source code
- Supporting documentation
- Test cases (where applicable)
